    "\n",
    "Ans: It requires some text corpora for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How can you train word2vec model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    " - By learning to predict context (neighboring words) given one word.\n",
    " - By minimizing crossentropy (aka maximizing likelihood).\n",
    " - By applying stochastic gradient descent.\n",
    " - By learning to predict omitted word by it's context.\n",
